# Implement PWA

Convert frontend to Progressive Web App with offline capability and installability.

## Implementation
- Create service worker with Workbox or custom
- Create app manifest (manifest.json)
- Register service worker in main.tsx
- Cache strategies:
  - Cache-first: Static assets (JS, CSS, images)
  - Network-first: API calls (with offline fallback)
  - Stale-while-revalidate: Analytics data
- Offline page for when network unavailable
- Background sync for queued operations

## Features
- Install prompt (Add to Home Screen)
- Offline mode indicator
- Cache API responses
- Service worker update notification
- Push notifications (web push)

## Testing
- Test offline functionality
- Test on mobile devices
- Test installation flow
- Test cache strategies

Execute end-to-end autonomously.
