# Setup E2E Testing

Implement end-to-end testing with Playwright for critical user journeys.

## Setup
- Add Playwright to project
- Create E2E test project: `tests/E2E/`
- Configure Playwright for multiple browsers
- Setup test fixtures (login, test data)

## Critical Journeys to Test
1. User registration and login
2. Navigate portfolio tree and view account details
3. Calculate TWR for account
4. Export holdings data
5. Create and manage benchmarks
6. View charts and analytics
7. User settings and preferences

## CI Integration
- Run E2E tests in CI pipeline
- Parallel test execution
- Screenshot/video on failure
- Retry flaky tests

Execute end-to-end autonomously.
