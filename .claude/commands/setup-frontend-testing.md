# Setup Frontend Testing

Set up Vitest and React Testing Library for comprehensive frontend test coverage.

## Setup
- Add Vitest, @testing-library/react, @testing-library/user-event, @testing-library/jest-dom
- Create vitest.config.ts
- Setup test utilities and mocks in `frontend/src/test/`
- Mock API calls with MSW (Mock Service Worker)
- Configure coverage reporting (target: 80%+)

## Test Infrastructure
- Create test utils: render with providers, mock store, mock router
- Create test data factories
- Setup global test setup file

## Example Tests
- Create example tests for common components
- Test patterns documentation

## Scripts
- Update package.json with test scripts:
  - `npm test` - run tests
  - `npm test:coverage` - coverage report
  - `npm test:watch` - watch mode

Execute end-to-end autonomously.
