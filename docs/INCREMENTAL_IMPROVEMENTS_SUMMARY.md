- **Remember Me** - Extended login sessions
- **Refresh Buttons** - Manual data refresh throughout app
- **Tooltips** - Explanations for metrics (TWR, Sharpe Ratio, etc.)
- **Dark Mode** - Theme toggle

## üìù Developer Notes

### Key Patterns Established
1. **Skeleton Components** - Use `Skeleton.tsx` for all loading states
2. **Logger Service** - Import from `services/logger` instead of console
3. **Environment Configs** - Use appsettings.{Environment}.json for env-specific settings
4. **Chart Visualization** - Recharts library is standard across app

### Configuration Changes Needed for Production
1. Set SMTP credentials in environment variables
2. Change JWT secret key
3. Disable admin seeding (`EnableSeeding: false`)
4. Set production database connection string
5. Configure email sending (`EnableEmailSending: true`)

### Testing Recommendations
1. Test email sending with real SMTP server
2. Test search with large datasets (100+ portfolios)
3. Verify skeleton loaders on slow connections
4. Test environment-specific configs
