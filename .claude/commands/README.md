# üöÄ Time-Weighted Return App: Improvement Command Library

This directory contains 50+ slash commands for transforming the Time-Weighted Return application into a best-in-class enterprise multi-tenant portfolio analytics platform.

## üìã Overview

Each command is a **feature-based, autonomous implementation** that:
- Implements the feature end-to-end (backend + frontend + tests + docs)
- Follows existing patterns and architecture
- Includes comprehensive testing
- Updates documentation
- Validates the build succeeds

## üéØ Quick Start

### Execute Your First Command

```bash
# Start with a quick win - add dark mode
/add-dark-mode

# Or expose existing export functionality in the UI
/expose-export-ui
```

### Check Progress

```bash
# See what's been completed
/status-overview

# Get recommendation for what to do next
/next-feature

# Validate everything still works
/validate-build
```

## üéØ Recommended Execution Strategy

### Strategy 1: Sequential by Phase (Recommended)

**Best for:** Systematic transformation, building solid foundation

```bash
# Week 1-2: Quick Wins
/add-dark-mode
/expose-export-ui
/setup-docker-dev
/improve-loading-states
/add-keyboard-shortcuts-help

# Month 1-2: Phase 1 (Foundation)
/implement-multitenancy     # START HERE!
/add-audit-trail
/add-activity-logging
/implement-subscriptions
/add-gdpr-compliance
/add-api-keys

# Month 2-4: Phase 2 (Features)
# ... continue with Phase 2 commands

# And so on...
```

### Strategy 2: Value-Driven (Mix of phases)

**Best for:** Delivering user value continuously

```bash
# Week 1: Quick visual wins
/add-dark-mode
/improve-loading-states
/expose-export-ui

# Week 2-3: Critical features
/implement-data-import      # High user value
/add-pdf-reports           # Business value

# Week 4-5: Foundation (can't delay much longer)
/implement-multitenancy

# Week 6-7: More features
/implement-global-search
/add-custom-dashboards

# Continue mixing...
```

### Strategy 3: Minimal Viable Enterprise (MVP)

**Best for:** Quick to market with essential enterprise features

```bash
# Core enterprise features only:
/implement-multitenancy
/add-audit-trail
/implement-subscriptions
/add-api-keys
/implement-data-import
/add-pdf-reports
/setup-cicd-pipeline
/create-docker-production
/setup-monitoring
```

## üí° Best Practices

### Before Starting a Command

1. **Check dependencies:** Does this command depend on others?
2. **Check current state:** Is any part already implemented?
3. **Backup/commit:** Ensure clean git state before starting
4. **Review command:** Read the command file to understand scope

### After Completing a Command

1. **Run validation:**
   ```bash
   /validate-build
   ```

2. **Test manually:**
   - Start the application
   - Test the new feature
   - Check for regressions

3. **Commit changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: implement [feature name] via /command-name"
   git push
   ```

4. **Update progress:**
   ```bash
   /status-overview
   ```

5. **Get next recommendation:**
   ```bash
   /next-feature
   ```

### Quality Standards

Each command should result in:
- ‚úÖ All tests passing (backend + frontend)
- ‚úÖ No linting errors
- ‚úÖ No TypeScript errors
- ‚úÖ No console errors or warnings
- ‚úÖ Build succeeds for both backend and frontend
- ‚úÖ New features tested (unit + integration)
- ‚úÖ Documentation updated

## üö® Important Notes

### Multi-Tenancy is Critical

‚ö†Ô∏è **Start with `/implement-multitenancy` if targeting enterprise deployment.** Many Phase 1 features depend on it:
- Audit trail (needs OrganizationId)
- Subscriptions (per organization)
- GDPR compliance (data isolation)
- Activity logging (tenant context)

If you skip multi-tenancy, you'll need to refactor later (expensive).

### Testing Strategy

- **Set up testing infrastructure early:**
  - `/setup-frontend-testing` after implementing a few features
  - Write tests as you go, not at the end
- **Minimum coverage goals:**
  - Backend: 80%+ for critical paths
  - Frontend: 60%+ for components
  - E2E: Cover critical user journeys

### Performance Considerations

- Implement caching early if dealing with large datasets
- Add pagination before users complain about slow tables
- Background jobs prevent UI blocking for long operations

### DevOps First Approach (Optional)

Consider setting up CI/CD and Docker early:
- `/setup-docker-dev` (Week 1 - Quick Win)
- `/setup-cicd-pipeline` (Month 2)
- This enables continuous validation and faster feedback
