# Sprint 4.5: Enhanced TWR with Cash Flow Categorization - Complete! ‚úÖ

## üéØ Overview

This enhancement adds professional-grade cash flow management to our TWR calculations, following GIPS (Global Investment Performance Standards) guidelines for proper treatment of portfolio cash flows.

## üè¶ Financial Standards Compliance

### GIPS-Compliant Cash Flow Categories

#### 1. Performance-Influencing Flows (Keep in TWR)

**These represent returns earned by the portfolio assets and stay in the calculation numerator:**

- **Income Generated Inside Portfolio**

  - Cash or reinvested stock dividends
  - Bond coupons / accrued interest adjustments
  - Interest earned on cash holdings

- **Realized P/L**

  - Proceeds vs. cost on security sales
  - Trading gains/losses

- **Expense Items (Net-of-Fee Reporting)**
  - Management, performance, or custody fees
  - Transaction commissions, bid-offer spread, stamp duty
  - Tax withheld or reclaimed within the portfolio

#### 2. External Flows (Strip Out & Break TWR Sub-Periods)

**These represent client-driven capital flows that must be excluded from performance:**

- **Contributions/Deposits**

  - Client wires cash in
  - Capital calls in PE funds

- **Withdrawals/Distributions**

  - Regular income drawdowns
  - Lump-sum withdrawals
  - Income paid out of the portfolio

- **Transfers**
  - In-kind ACAT/ISA transfers
  - Free-of-payment asset moves

#### 3. Internal Movements (No TWR Impact)

**These are accounting adjustments with no performance impact:**

- Internal transfers between portfolio sleeves
- Cash sweeps and automatic management
- Settlement adjustments
- Accrued interest adjustments

## üíª Technical Implementation

### Domain Model

```csharp
public class CashFlow
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
    public Guid AccountId { get; set; }
    public DateOnly Date { get; set; }
    public decimal Amount { get; set; } // Positive = inflow, Negative = outflow
    public string Description { get; set; }
    public CashFlowType Type { get; set; }
    public CashFlowCategory Category { get; set; }
    public string? TransactionReference { get; set; }
}

public enum CashFlowCategory
{
    PerformanceInfluencing = 1,  // Keep in TWR numerator
    ExternalFlow = 2,            // Break TWR sub-periods
    Internal = 3                 // No TWR impact
}
```

### Enhanced TWR Calculation

```csharp
public class EnhancedTimeWeightedReturnService
{
    public EnhancedTwrResult Calculate(
        IEnumerable<ValuationPoint> valuations,
        IEnumerable<CashFlow> cashFlows,
        DateRange period)
    {
        // Filter cash flows by category
        var externalFlows = cashFlows
            .Where(cf => cf.Category == CashFlowCategory.ExternalFlow)
            .OrderBy(cf => cf.Date);

        var performanceFlows = cashFlows
            .Where(cf => cf.Category == CashFlowCategory.PerformanceInfluencing)
            .OrderBy(cf => cf.Date);

        // Create sub-periods broken by external flows
        var subPeriods = CreateSubPeriods(valuations, externalFlows, period);

        // Calculate TWR for each sub-period including performance flows
        // Formula: (End Value - Start Value - Performance Flows) / Start Value
    }
}
```

## üìä Sample Data Scenarios

### ISA Account Cash Flows

- **2025-01-15**: ¬£125.50 AAPL Dividend (Performance-Influencing)
- **2025-02-10**: ¬£45.20 Interest on Cash (Performance-Influencing)
- **2025-03-01**: ¬£5,000 Client Contribution (External Flow - breaks TWR)
- **2025-04-15**: ¬£135.75 AAPL Dividend (Performance-Influencing)
- **2025-05-01**: -¬£25.00 Management Fee (Performance-Influencing)

### GIA Account Cash Flows

- **2025-02-20**: ¬£187.50 MSFT Dividend (Performance-Influencing)
- **2025-03-15**: -¬£12.75 Dividend Tax Withholding (Performance-Influencing)
- **2025-04-01**: -¬£1,500 Client Withdrawal (External Flow - breaks TWR)
- **2025-05-20**: ¬£195.80 MSFT Dividend (Performance-Influencing)

## üîÑ TWR Sub-Period Breaks

When external flows occur, the TWR calculation automatically breaks into sub-periods:

**Example: ISA Account (6 months with 1 external flow)**

- **Sub-Period 1**: Dec 11, 2024 ‚Üí Feb 28, 2025 (before contribution)
- **Sub-Period 2**: Mar 2, 2025 ‚Üí Jun 11, 2025 (after contribution)

Each sub-period includes performance-influencing flows in the calculation but excludes the external flow that broke the period.
